# Shopping Cart

## [Shopping Cart]()

## Description
This is my submission for the assignment Shopping Cart for the curriculum The Odin Project. This took a long time to complete due to things which happen in life. I was able to give like 30 mins to this. I could have given more than 30 but it is what it is. I could have completely stop with the odin project but I kept going still because on reddit I read it is better to do something badly rather not doing at all(eg exericising for 5 min a day is better than not exercising at all). Still I have not been able to style it using css. I have submitted it because I want to proceed with the course. I keep adding css when I have time. So it is ongoing thing. I tried my best to do it in the best way possible but due to time constraints it might be not that good, so sorry. I will try to keep adding things to it.

#### Notes:
- I am fetching the home page product data when all products are not loaded but when all(20) product are loaded then I am going to pick a random product from this instead of making fetch calls. Note: Ask people if the way I doing the things for the homepage is correct on not.
- We are going to provide a number drop down list on the products page and the person can choose the number from there and then press add to cart which will add that quantity of that particular item to the cart. The default value of the item will be 1 and max will be 10.
- On the cart page we will provide the **+** and **-** buttons to increase and fine tune the item quantity and a remove from cart button.
- The **+** will become inactive when the item quantity is 10 and similarly the **-** will be inactive when the quantity of the item is 1.
- There are 4 category here. Men's clothing women's clothing jewelery electronics

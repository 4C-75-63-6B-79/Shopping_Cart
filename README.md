# Shopping Cart

#### Notes:
- I am fetching the home page product data when all products are not loaded but when all(20) product are loaded then I am going to pick a random product from this instead of making fetch calls. Note: Ask people if the way I doing the things for the homepage is correct on not.
- We are going to provide a number drop down list on the products page and the person can choose the number from there and then press add to cart which will add that quantity of that particular item to the cart. The default value of the item will be 1 and max will be 10.
- On the cart page we will provide the **+** and **-** buttons to increase and fine tune the item quantity and a remove from cart button.
- The **+** will become inactive when the item quantity is 10 and similarly the **-** will be inactive when the quantity of the item is 1.
